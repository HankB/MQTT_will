# Ansible tasks
# - kill MQTT_will if already running
# - verify that libpaho-mqtt1.3 is installed
# - copy binary and extra script (which may vary by host)
# And don't forget to deal with overlayfs on Raspberry Pi's
# run with .e.g.
#   ansible-playbook deploy-MQTT_will.yml -i olive, -K \
#   [ -e alt_extra=MWTT_extra-someother.sh]
# Not sure why the comma is there but it matters. 

# This variant works with Pis that employ the overlayfs and will
# disable that, reboot, deploy, enable overlayfs, reboot
# It requires that https://github.com/HankB/Ansible be installed 
# at the same level as this repo.
